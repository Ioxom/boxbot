## Welcome to IoxCorp

Welcome to IoxCorp, the worlds next innovation center.
Here at IoxCorp, we are making the future... today! We specialize in making programs for high tech objects and systems.

### History

The IoxCorp was founded in 04/01/20 by the "Ioxom Foundation", and is actively being sponsored by "The Birch Tree", It is also funded by "Thonkman"






# Our projects

Our current project is IoxBox, a discord bot oriented around storing things in your personal box. You will be able to store sentences, numbers eventually (and hopefully files). One day I imagine it being the best bot on discord with more than just storing things in boxes.

### IoxBox objectives

- 24/7 activity
- Storing things in boxes
- Encryption
- Better website
- And much more


# Behind the creators

Ioxom and Thonkman are both Canadian nationals currently living in Manitoba (yes it exists). Ioxom began his programming career in 2018 after recieving a book on C++ from Thonkman. Although he did not continue using C++ and switched to Java. Thonkman started a few months later after being convinced it was a good idea. They both had begun with Scratch and made a few games together. Together they've had many succesful and many unsuccesful ideas and programs. Most of which are posted on their Githubs'. Thonkmans first succesful program was Thonkybot (JS edition), a discord bot made in javascript, it didnt go far but it worked at least. Ioxoms first program was IoxBot (JS), a very well made bot. Later on both bots were transfered to regular Java where Thonkybot stopped being developed. IoxBot is still actively being worked on. 


## Our skills

Ioxom is a very powerful programmer with lots of skills and critical thinking ability, he can write his own code whenever he wants.

Thonkman is an ok programmer with the skills of a bag of bricks and the critical thinking strengths of an undercooked onion ring.

They are both actively taking lessons to improve their skills.
